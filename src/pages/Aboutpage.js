              Stem Cell Transplantation or Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT) is
              the known cure for sickle cell disorder. Sickle Cell Foundation
              Nigeria (SCFN) and Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) have
              partnered to establish a BMT Programme in Lagos, in order that
              excellent quality, safe, affordable and life-changing cure for
              sickle cell disorder will be locally available and accessible to
              Nigerians in Nigeria. This is indeed fitting as Nigeria is by far
              the country with the highest burden of sickle cell disorder in the
              world. Over 40 million Nigerians are carriers of the sickle cell
              gene and an estimated 150,000 babies are born every year with
              sickle cell in the country. Sadly, 100,000 of these babies do not
              live to celebrate their 5th birthday â€“ dying mostly from ignorance
              and lack of access to proper diagnosis, treatment and care.

                  Our BMT Journey:
                </span>
                Our BMT journey started in 2011 when SCFN and LUTH partnered
                with the Mediterranean Institute of Haematology (IME) Rome and
                nearly 50 Nigerian children travelled to Italy and received free
                BMT. However, the programme was abruptly terminated due to
                funding challenges in Italy.

                Following the cessation of our BMT project with IME Rome, SCFN

                formalisation of partnership with the institution via an MoU in
                2020 with VUMC as technical partners, for the establishment of
                our own BMT Centre in Lagos, Nigeria.
